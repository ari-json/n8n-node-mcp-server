## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip
- git

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/ari-json/n8n-node-mcp-server.git
cd n8n-node-mcp-server

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=.

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_server.py
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Style

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with these specifics:

- **Line length**: 100 characters maximum
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Imports**: Grouped and sorted
  ```python
  # Standard library
  import os
  import sys
  
  # Third-party
  import httpx
  from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
  
  # Local
  from .utils import helper_function
  ```

### Code Formatting

We recommend using:
- **black** for automatic formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting

```bash
# Format code
black server.py

# Sort imports
isort server.py

# Check linting
flake8 server.py
```

### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def function_name(param1: str, param2: int) -> dict:
    """Brief description of function.
    
    More detailed description if needed.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: When invalid input provided
    """
```

### Type Hints

Use type hints for function parameters and returns:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

def process_nodes(node_names: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Process node information."""
    pass
```

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Name test files with `test_` prefix
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions

Example test:

```python
import pytest
from server import search_nodes

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_search_nodes_found():
    """Test searching for nodes with results."""
    result = await search_nodes("HTTP")
    assert "HTTP" in result
    assert "Found" in result

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_search_nodes_not_found():
    """Test searching for non-existent nodes."""
    result = await search_nodes("NonExistentNode123")
    assert "No nodes found" in result
```

## Documentation
